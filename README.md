# FirstCProgramVSCode
Setting up to run my first C program using the VSCode IDE

I have been using Visual Studio for a very long time.
I mostly develop code in C / C++ with Visual Studio.
I decided to try VSCode.
If you are interested in my comments and experience I invite you

Keep in mind that one of the best ways to learn is to read and experiment.

Enjoy;
